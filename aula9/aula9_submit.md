Mais valias:
    Stored Procedures: Extensibilidade, performance, segurança e integridade de dados e reutilização de código

    UDFs: Extensibilidade, reutilização de código e simplicidade

Diferenças:
    - Valores de retorno: Stored Procedures podem retornar zero, um ou múltiplos resultados, e também parâmetros de saída. UDFs devem retornar exatamente um valor e não podem usar parâmetros de saída.
    - Consultas SQL: UDFs podem ser incorporadas dentro de consultas SQL, enquanto Stored Procedures não podem.
